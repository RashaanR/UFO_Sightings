# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage and dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of 
UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time with filters for the city, 
state, country, and shapes.

## Results

To simply run a query, all you have to do is fill any filters that you desire. The number of filters to enter is 
up to you. Simple just follow the format of the placeholders and the table will filter to the data you would like to see

## summary
One drawback of this webpage is that we dont have a button to download the a filtered table if we wanted to. 

Two reccomendations would be to include images in the table if possible or a link to supporting articals about 
per sighting.
